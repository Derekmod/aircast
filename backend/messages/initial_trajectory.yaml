  user_message: I have a paper that I am struggling to understand... Can you help
    me?

  user_message: 'I would like you to extract a few (between 1 and 5, inclusive) topics
    that the paper is pushing the frontier on. For example, if the paper is about
    inserting a gene into corn using a new technique to make the plant more robust
    to drought, you might extract:

    1. Using a new technique to insert genes

    2. Corn genetic modifications

    3. Corn robustness to drought


    Now I would like you to do the same for a paper I will give you now. I''ll provide
    the abstract, introduction, and conclusion.


    Are you ready?'
